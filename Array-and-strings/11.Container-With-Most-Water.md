## Problem Description
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents apoint at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
## Ideas
```
1) The area is affected by the distance and shorter height of the two points
2) We want to design an algorithm that takes these two factors
```
## Algorithm Analysis
```
Step 1) set up start and end pointers at each ends
Step 2) move the shorter line inward at each iteration and recompute area

This can be thought of:
if f[start] <= f[end]
    start = start + 1
    update area
else:
    end = end - 1
    update area

where f[i] represents the height of the array
```

## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        start, end = 0, len(height) - 1
        area = 0
        while start != end:
            area = max(area, min(height[start], height[end]) * (end - start))
            if (height[start] <= height[end]):
                start += 1
            else:
                end -=1
        return area
        
```
