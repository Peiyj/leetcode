## Problem Description
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Example 1:
```
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
Note:

The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
Both num1 and num2 contain only digits 0-9.
Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
```
## Ideas
```
The idea is to use grade school algorithm (n^2)
```
## Algorithm Analysis
```
Step 1) loop through each digit d1 and d2.

Step 2) multiple them together with base 10 ** (len(num1) - 1 - i1) or base 10 ** (len(num2) - 1 - i1)
```

## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def multiply(self, num1, num2):
        """
        :type num1: str
        :type num2: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        ans = 0
        for i1, d1 in enumerate(num1):
            for i2, d2 in enumerate(num2):
                base1 = 10**(len(num1) - 1 - i1)
                base2 = 10**(len(num2) - 1 - i2)
                mul1 = base1 * int(d1)
                mul2 = base2 * int(d2)
                ans = ans + mul1 * mul2
        return str(ans)
        
```
## Complexity Analysis
```
Time complexity:
