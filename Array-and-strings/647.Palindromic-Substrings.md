## Problem Description
Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
``` 

Example 2:
```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```
## Ideas
We can expand from the center and check if string[l] == string[r]

There are two cases:

abba

ababa
## Algorithm Analysis

Step 1) loop through the sequence

Step 2) At each letter, check substring (l, l) and check substring(l, l+1)

Step 3) if check substring matches at each iteration, self.ans  += 1
## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def countSubstrings(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.count = 0
        for c in range(len(s)):
            self.checkSubstring(c, c, s)
            self.checkSubstring(c, c+1, s)
        return self.count
    def checkSubstring(self, left, right, s):
        while left >= 0 and right <= len(s) - 1 and s[left] == s[right]:
            self.count += 1
            left -= 1
            right += 1
       
```
