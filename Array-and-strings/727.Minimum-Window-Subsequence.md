## Problem Description
Given strings S and T, find the minimum (contiguous) substring W of S, so that T is a subsequence of W.

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "". If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
S = "abcdebdde", T = "bde"
Output: "bcde"
Explanation: 
"bcde" is the answer because it occurs before "bdde" which has the same length.
"deb" is not a smaller window because the elements of T in the window must occur in order.
```

Note:
```
All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.
The length of S will be in the range [1, 20000].
The length of T will be in the range [1, 100].
```

## Ideas
We start with two pointers, left and right initially pointing to the first element of the string SS.

We use the right pointer to expand the window until we get a desirable window i.e. a window that contains all of the characters of T.

Once we have a window with all the characters, we can move the left pointer ahead one by one. If the window is still a desirable one we keep on updating the minimum window size.

If the window is not desirable any more, we repeat step 2 onwards.
