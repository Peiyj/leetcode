## Problem Description

Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Example 1:
```
Input: 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
```

## Ideas
0 can only be formed by 2 * 5.

## Algorithm Analysis
The ZERO comes from 10.
The 10 comes from 2 x 5
And we need to account for all the products of 5 and 2. likes 4Ã—5 = 20 ...
So, if we take all the numbers with 5 as a factor, we'll have way more than enough even numbers to pair with them to get factors of 10


## Code

```py
class Solution(object):
    def trailingZeroes(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        num_zero = 0
        while n >= 5:
            n /= 5
            num_zero += n
        return num_zero
        
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
Time complexity: O(log n)

Space complexity: O(1)
```
