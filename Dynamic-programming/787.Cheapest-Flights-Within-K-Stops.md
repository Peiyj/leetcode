## Problem Description

There are n cities connected by m flights. Each flight starts from city u and arrives at v with a price w.

Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city src and the destination dst, your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with up to k stops. If there is no such route, output -1.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:


The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:


The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
Note:

The number of nodes n will be in range [1, 100], with nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
The size of flights will be in range [0, n * (n - 1) / 2].
The format of each flight will be (src, dst, price).
The price of each flight will be in the range [1, 10000].
k is in the range of [0, n - 1].
There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.
```
## Ideas

The idea is to simulate dijastra's algorithm to solve this problem.

## Algorithm Analysis
```
F[i][j] = min(f[i-1][j] + cost[i][j], f[i][j-1] + cost[i][j])
```
## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n, flights, src, dst, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type flights: List[List[int]]
        :type src: int
        :type dst: int
        :type K: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        flight_map = {}
        for start, end, cost in flights:
            if start not in flight_map:
                flight_map[start] = {end:cost}
            else:
                flight_map[start][end] = cost
        heap = [(0, src, k + 1)]
        while heap:
            cost, dest, stops = heappop(heap)
            if dest == dst:
                return cost
            if stops > 0 and dest in flight_map:
                for next_dst, price in flight_map[dest].items():
                    heappush(heap, (cost + price, next_dst, stops - 1))
        return -1
        
```
