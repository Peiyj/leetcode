## Problem Description

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
```
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```
## Ideas

The idea is to use DFS or BFS to find all nodes that have 1s.


## Algorithm Analysis
```
DFS on number of islands that is 1
Turn them into '#' once visited.
```
## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        ans = 0
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[r])):
                # print(grid)
                if grid[r][c] == '1':
                    ans += 1
                    self.dfs(r,c,grid)
        return ans
    def dfs(self, r, c, grid):
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r > len(grid) - 1 or c > len(grid[r]) - 1 or grid[r][c] != '1':
            return
        else:
            grid[r][c] = '#'
        self.dfs(r+1, c, grid)
        self.dfs(r-1, c, grid)
        self.dfs(r, c+1, grid)
        self.dfs(r, c-1, grid)  
           
        
```
