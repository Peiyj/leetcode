## Problem Description
According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Example:
```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```

1) Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
2) In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?
```
## Ideas
The intuition comes from the current cell is affected by its neighboring cells. Meaning that we should store a neighbor array to indicate the relative position of the its neighbor. 

neighbors = [(-1, 0), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)].

To do this in-place, we can first loop through the board to set the current cell to some placeholder value and set it back in the second loop. 

For the second follow-up question, here's a solution for an infinite board. Instead of a two-dimensional array of ones and zeros, I represent the board as a set of live cell coordinates.
```py
def gameOfLifeInfinite(self, live):
    ctr = collections.Counter((I, J)
                              for i, j in live
                              for I in range(i-1, i+2)
                              for J in range(j-1, j+2)
                              if I != i or J != j)
    return {ij
            for ij in ctr
            if ctr[ij] == 3 or ctr[ij] == 2 and ij in live}
```
And here's a wrapper that uses the above infinite board solution to solve the problem we have here at the OJ (submitted together, this gets accepted):

```py
def gameOfLife(self, board):
    live = {(i, j) for i, row in enumerate(board) for j, live in enumerate(row) if live}
    live = self.gameOfLifeInfinite(live)
    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j in range(len(row)):
            row[j] = int((i, j) in live)
```
## Algorithm Analysis
Step 1) initialize neighbor array
Step 2) mark the cell based on the neighbor array cells as 2 or 3
Step 3) change the affected cell back to 0 or 1
