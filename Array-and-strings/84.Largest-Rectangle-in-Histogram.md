## Problem Description
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

![84.histogram.png](../asset/84.histogram.png)

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

![84.histogram_area.png](../asset/84.histogram_area.png)

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

Example:
```
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```
## Ideas
The intuition comes from: area = height x width. In this case, we need to use 
the shorter height to find the area. At each iteration, if the height is higher
or equal, we add to our data schedule while storing their position. Till, we meet
a rectangle that is shorter, do we start to calculate the area. The perfect data structure
would be stack in this case.
## Algorithm Analysis
Step 1) initialize our height and position stack
Step 2) populate our stacks if f[i+1] >= f[i]. where f is our original heights array
Step 3) stop when f[i+1] < f[i]. Then we recursively look back to find such f[i+1] >= f[i].
Update area = max(area, popped_height * (curr_index - popped_index))
Step 4) add back the new height and last popped_index to the two stacks
## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights):
        """
        :type heights: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        from collections import deque
        heights.append(0)
        pos = deque()
        height = deque()
        area = 0
        for currIndex, val in enumerate(heights):
            if (not height or val >= height[len(height) - 1]): # new height record
                pos.append(currIndex)
                height.append(val)
            else: # new low 
                initPos = -1
                while height and val < height[len(height) - 1]:
                    currHeight = height.pop()
                    initPos = pos.pop()
                    area = max(area, currHeight * (currIndex - initPos))
                pos.append(initPos)
                height.append(val)
        return area
