## Problem Description

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example:
```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```
After running your function, the board should be:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```
Explanation:

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

## Ideas

The idea is very similar to Go. We can solve this problem by doing DFS on 'O'. If any of the 'O' is at any of the boundary. We do not change them. Else, we change them to 'X'. 


## Algorithm Analysis
```
step 1) retrieve all border celles

step 2) mark the "escaped cells" with "E"

step 3) turn 'O' -> 'X' and 'E' -> 'O'
```
## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def solve(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        if not board or not board[0]:
            return
        self.ROWS = len(board)
        self.COLS = len(board[0])
        # step 1) retrieve all border celles
        from itertools import product
        borders = list(product(range(self.ROWS), [0, self.COLS-1]))  \
                + list(product([0, self.ROWS-1], range(self.COLS)))
        # step 2) mark the "escaped cells" with "E"
        for r, c in borders:
            if board[r][c] == 'O':
                self.DFS(board, r, c)
        # step 3) turn 'O' -> 'X' and 'E' -> 'O'
        for r in range(self.ROWS):
            for c in range(self.COLS):
                if board[r][c] == 'O':
                    board[r][c] = 'X'
                elif board[r][c] == 'E':
                    board[r][c] = 'O'
    
    def DFS(self, board, r, c):
        if board[r][c] != 'O':
            return
        board[r][c] = 'E'
        if c < self.COLS - 1:
            self.DFS(board, r, c+1)
        if r < self.ROWS - 1:
            self.DFS(board, r+1, c)
        if c > 0:
            self.DFS(board, r, c-1)
        if r > 0:
            self.DFS(board, r-1, c)
```
