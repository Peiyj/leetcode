## Problem Description
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```
## Ideas
```
Use a dictionary to record count of each number.

Return the key with the max count.
```
## Algorithm Analysis
```
We can use a HashMap that maps elements to counts in order to count occurrences in linear time by looping over nums. Then, we simply return the key with maximum value.
```

## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        max_frequency = 0
        curr_num = -1
        num_dict = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num in num_dict:
                num_dict[num] += 1
            else:
                num_dict[num] = 1
        for key, val in num_dict.items():
            if val > max_frequency:
                curr_num = key
                max_frequency = val
        return curr_num 
```
