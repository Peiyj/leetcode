## Problem Description

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4 

Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output:  1
```
## Ideas

The idea is to create a graph.

Call DFS on each unvisited edge.

Return number of such calls.

## Algorithm Analysis
```
Step 1) create the graph with components
Step 2) call DFS on unvisited components. ans += 1
Step 3) return ans


```
## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def countComponents(self, n, edges):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type edges: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        edges_dict = collections.defaultdict(dict)
        ans = 0
        visited_dict = {}
        for i in range(n):
            visited_dict[i] = 1
        for node1, node2 in edges:
            edges_dict[node1][node2] = 1
            edges_dict[node2][node1] = 1
        while visited_dict:
            ans += 1
            nodeQ = [visited_dict.keys()[0]]
            while nodeQ:   
                node = nodeQ.pop(0)
                if node in visited_dict:
                    del visited_dict[node]
                for neighbor in edges_dict[node].keys():
                    nodeQ.append(neighbor)
                    del edges_dict[node][neighbor]
        return ans
```
