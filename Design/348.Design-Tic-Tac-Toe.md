## Problem Description
Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Example:
```
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```
## Ideas

In order to win the game, one player needs to occupy all elements in any row, cols or one diagonal or one antidiagonal.

## Algorithm Analysis
```
Move:
To keep track of which player, I add one for Player1 and -1 for Player2. There are two additional variables to keep track 
of the count of the diagonals. Each time a player places a piece we just need to check the count of that row, column, 
diagonal and anti-diagonal.
  
```
## Code
```py
class TicTacToe(object):

    def __init__(self, n):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        :type n: int
        """
        self.rows = [0] * n
        self.cols = [0] * n
        self.diagonal = 0
        self.antidiagonal = 0
        self.n = n
    def move(self, row, col, player):
        """
        Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins.

        """
        if player == 1:
            self.rows[row] += 1
            self.cols[col] += 1
            if row == col:
                self.diagonal += 1
            if row + col == self.n - 1:
                self.antidiagonal += 1
        else:
            self.rows[row] -= 1
            self.cols[col] -= 1
            if row == col:
                self.diagonal -= 1

                self.antidiagonal -= 1
        if self.rows[row] == self.n or self.cols[col] == self.n \
            or self.diagonal == self.n or self.antidiagonal == self.n:
            return 1
        elif self.rows[row] == -self.n or self.cols[col] == -self.n \
            or self.diagonal == -self.n or self.antidiagonal == -self.n:
            return 2
        else:
            return 0
        


# Your TicTacToe object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = TicTacToe(n)
# param_1 = obj.move(row,col,player)
```
