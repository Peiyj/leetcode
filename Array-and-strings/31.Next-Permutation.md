## Problem Description
Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1

## Ideas
Let's denote F[e] to be the ending digit of the number.
The intuition comes from when we swap elements. We want to find the next decreasing
digit to swap with. Now e points to the next decreasing element. Then, we know from 0..e-1
positions, the sequence is still in increasing order which will not give us the next permutation.
Instead, we want to swap the subarray to make sure they are in decreasing order.
## Algorithm Analysis
First, we observe that for any given sequence that is in descending order, no next larger permutation is possible. For example, no next permutation is possible for the following array:

[9, 5, 4, 3, 1]
We need to find the first pair of two successive numbers a[i]a[i] and a[i-1]a[i−1], from the right, which satisfy a[i] > a[i-1]a[i]>a[i−1]. Now, no rearrangements to the right of a[i-1]a[i−1] can create a larger permutation since that subarray consists of numbers in descending order. Thus, we need to rearrange the numbers to the right of a[i-1]a[i−1] including itself.

Now, what kind of rearrangement will produce the next larger number? We want to create the permutation just larger than the current one. Therefore, we need to replace the number a[i-1]a[i−1] with the number which is just larger than itself among the numbers lying to its right section, say a[j]a[j].

        mid = start + (end - start + 1)/2
        while start < mid:

            start += 1
            end -= 1
