## Problem Description

```
Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:

[
  "((()))",
  "(()())",
  "(())()",
  "()(())",
  "()()()"
]

```

## Ideas

Instead of adding '(' or ')' every time as in Approach 1, let's only add them when we know it will remain a valid sequence. 
We can do this by keeping track of the number of opening and closing brackets we have placed so far.

We can start an opening bracket if we still have one (of n) left to place. And we can start a closing bracket if it would not 
exceed the number of opening brackets.

## Algorithm Analysis

1) Store left and right count as numbers of left or right parenthesises
2) Only append the output string to the list if it reaches 2 * N complexity
3) Set leftbound < N and rightbound < leftbound

## Code

```py
def generateParenthesis(self, N):
    output = []
    def backtrack(output_string, left, right):
        if len(output_string) == 2 * N:
            output.append(output_string)
            return
        if left < N:
            backtrack(output_string + '(', left + 1, right)
        if right < left: # we only append if there are enough '('s
            backtrack(output_string + ')', left, right + 1)  
    backtrack('', 0, 0)
    return output
```
