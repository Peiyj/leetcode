## Problem Description
```
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

```
The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

## Ideas
```
The idea is to use DP to store the best cut at each subproblem i.
```
## Algorithm Analysis
```
Let's think about the function:
f[i][j], where 
i is the subarray bounded by 0,..,n (row value),
j is the number of cuts bounded by 0,..,m (col value),
k is the index to split the subarray (row value)

Essentially, at each iteration of the subproblem, we are taking the max 
of the each side, f[k][j - 1], sumArr[i] - sumArr[k].
For each k, we want to store the minimum value of f[i][j].

Therefore, we have:
f[i][j] = Math.min(f[i][j], Math.max(f[k][j - 1], sumArr[i] - sumArr[k]));
```

## Code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def splitArray(self, nums, m):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type m: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(nums)
        # f = [[sys.maxint] * (m + 1)] * (n + 1) # shallow copy
        f = [[sys.maxint for i in range(m + 1)] for j in range(n + 1)] 
        f[0][0] = 0
        print(f)
        sumArr = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            sumArr[i + 1] = sumArr[i] + nums[i]
        print(sumArr)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                for k in range(i):
                    f[i][j] = min(f[i][j], max(f[k][j-1], sumArr[i] - sumArr[k]))
        return f[n][m]
        
```
## Complexity Analysis
```
Time complexity: 
O(n) = n^2 * m
Space complexity: 
O(n) = n^2
