## Problem Description

Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function int findCelebrity(n). There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.

Example 1:

![277.image.png](../asset/277.image.png)


```
Input: graph = [
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
```
## Ideas

Intuition 1: brute force: we can verify each node to see if it is the celebrity by looking at each node
to see if every node knows the celebrity node and the celebrity node does not any of the node. This would be n^2 solution.

Intuition 2: logical reduction: if a knows b, a cannot be the celebrity. We can use this property to eliminate n - 1 candidates.

Intuition 3: cached logical reduction: if knows API call is costly, we can use cache to optimize our API call runtime.

## Algorithm Analysis
```
Step 1: define a cachedknows memoisation to return knows API 

Step 2: set celebrity node = 0. For each iteration from 1 to n, if celebrity node knows i, we set celebrity nodoe = i.

Step 3: check celebrity node one last time to make sure it is the node.
```
## Code
```py
# The knows API is already defined for you.
# return a bool, whether a knows b
# def knows(a: int, b: int) -> bool:

from functools import lru_cache
class Solution:
    @lru_cache(maxsize==None)
    def cachedKnows(self, a, b):
        return knows(a, b)
    
    def findCelebrity(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """  
        celebrity = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if self.cachedKnows(celebrity, i): # if a -> b, a cannot be celebrity. Set a = b
                celebrity = i
        if self.isCelebrity(celebrity, n):
            return celebrity
        return -1
    def isCelebrity(self, b, n):
        for a in range(n):
            if a == b:
                continue
            if self.cachedKnows(b, a) or not self.cachedKnows(a, b):
                return False
        return True
        
```
