## Problem Description

```
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example:

board =
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]

Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
Given word = "SEE", return true.
Given word = "ABCB", return false.

```

## Ideas
At every node, we call graph search to find all the solutions around that node

## Algorithm Analysis

This is a generic template algorithm to solve backtracking problem
```py
def backtrack(candidate):
    if find_solution(candidate):
        output(candidate)
        return
    # iterate all possible candidates.
    for next_candidate in list_of_candidates:
        if is_valid(next_candidate):
            # try this partial candidate solution
            place(next_candidate)
            # given the candidate, explore further.
            backtrack(next_candidate)
            # backtrack
            remove(next_candidate)
```

Specifically the approach to solve this problem:

Step 1). At the beginning, first we check if we reach the bottom case of the recursion, where the word to be matched is empty, 
i.e. we have already found the match for each prefix of the word.

Step 2). We then check if the current state is invalid, either the position of the cell is out of the boundary of the board 
or the letter in the current cell does not match with the first letter of the word.

Step 3). If the current step is valid, we then start the exploration of backtracking with the strategy of DFS. 
First, we mark the current cell as visited, e.g. any non-alphabetic letter will do. Then we iterate through the four 
possible directions, namely up, right, down and left. The order of the directions can be altered, to one's preference.

Step 4). At the end of the exploration, we revert the cell back to its original state. Finally we return the result of the exploration.

## Code

```py
class Solution(object):
    def exist(self, board, word):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if (self.backtrack(board, word, i, j) == True):
                    return True
        return False
    def backtrack(self, board, word, row, col):
        if len(word) == 0:
            return True
        if row < 0 or row >= len(board) or col < 0 or col >= len(board[0]) or board[row][col] != word[0]:
            return False
        ret = False
        board[row][col] = '#'
        for rowOffset, colOffset in [(0, 1),(-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 0)]:
            ret = self.backtrack(board, word[1:], row + rowOffset, col + colOffset)
            if ret == True: # found the solution
                break
        board[row][col] = word[0]
        return ret
