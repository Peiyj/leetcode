## Problem Description

Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:
```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```
## Ideas
This can be reduced to log(n) solution using binary search
## Algorithm Analysis
Constantly modify left and right pointer to m + 1 and m - 1 respectfully.
Return right pointer since the last iteration says r = m - 1.
## Code

```py
class Solution(object):
    def mySqrt(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if x == 1:
            return 1
        l, r = 0, x
        while l <= r:
            m = l + (r - l)/2
            if (m*m) > x:
                r = m - 1
            elif (m*m) < x:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                return m
        # at the last iteration l is greater than m and r is less than m, hence we return r
        return r
```

## Complexity Analysis
