## Link To The Problem 
https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/

## Problem Description
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example: 
```
You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
```
## Ideas

Use DFS (preorder) to encode and decode.

Nonlocal variable maybe helpful.

## Algorithm Analysis
```
Encode:
Step 1) if root does not exist, add 'None' to the string
Step 2) print the root, add the value of the root to the string
Step 3) visit root.left and root.right
Step 4) output the string

Decode:
Step 1) formulate an array of nodes
Step 2) pop the front of the array
Step 3) create the root object and set the value to be the root's value
Step 4) set root.left to be the recurisve call and set root.right to be the recursive call
  
```
## Code
```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        ans = ''
        def preorder(root):
            nonlocal ans 
            if not root:
                ans = ans + 'None,'
            else:
                ans = ans + str(root.val) + ','
                preorder(root.left)
                preorder(root.right)
        preorder(root)
        return ans[:len(ans)-1] if ans else ''
        

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        nodes = data.split(',')
        def preorder(dataList):
            value = dataList.pop(0)
            if value == 'None':
                return None
            root = TreeNode(value)
            root.left = preorder(dataList)
            root.right = preorder(dataList)
            return root
        return preorder(nodes)
        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root))
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
Time complexity: O(total nodes)

Space complexity: O(total nodes)
