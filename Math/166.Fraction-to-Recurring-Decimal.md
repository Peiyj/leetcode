## Problem Description

Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.

If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

Example 1:
```
Input: numerator = 1, denominator = 2
Output: "0.5"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: numerator = 2, denominator = 1
Output: "2"
```
Example 3:
```
Input: numerator = 2, denominator = 3
Output: "0.(6)"
```
## Ideas

The same concept as long division.

## Algorithm Analysis
You will need a hash table that maps from the remainder to its position of the fractional part. Once you found a repeating remainder, you may enclose the reoccurring fractional part with parentheses by consulting the position from the table.

The remainder could be zero while doing the division. That means there is no repeating fractional part and you should stop right away.
## Code

```py
class Solution(object):
    def fractionToDecimal(self, numerator, denominator):
        """
        :type numerator: int
        :type denominator: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if (numerator % denominator == 0):
            return str(numerator / denominator)
        negCount = 0
        if (numerator < 0):
            numerator = -numerator
            negCount += 1
        if (denominator < 0):
            denominator = -denominator
            negCount += 1  
        ans = str(numerator / denominator) if negCount == 0 or negCount == 2 \
                            else '-' + str(numerator / denominator) 
        ans += '.'
        fraction = ''
        num_dict = {}
        pos = 0
        remainder = numerator % denominator
        while remainder != 0:   
            remainder *= 10
            quotient = remainder / denominator
            if remainder in num_dict:
                pos = num_dict[remainder]
                fraction = fraction[:pos] + '(' + fraction[pos:]
                fraction += ')'
                break
            else:
                num_dict[remainder] = pos
                fraction += str(quotient)
            pos += 1
            remainder = remainder % denominator
        return ans + fraction
