## Problem Description
Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

Example:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
```

Constraints:
```
The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
The integer n is in the range [0, 100].
```
## Ideas
```
Here are some observations:
1) letters don't matter
2) largest remaining task first because we want to interleave largest task with smaller ones to avoid idling

Approach 1: Sort. Keep track of the count of all letters in a list. Sort the list at each iteration

## Algorithm Analysis

There are two more approaches. I will update later.

## Code
```py

class Solution(object):
    # approach 1: Sorting
    def leastInterval(self, tasks, n):
        """
        :type tasks: List[str]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        tasks_map = [0] * 26
        numOfTasks = 0
        quantum = 0
        for task in tasks:
            tasks_map[ord(task) - ord('A')] += 1
            numOfTasks += 1
        tasks_map = sorted(tasks_map, reverse = True)
        while numOfTasks > 0:
            i = 0
            while i <= n:
                if (numOfTasks == 0):
                    break
                if (i <= 25 and tasks_map[i] > 0):
                    numOfTasks -= 1
                    tasks_map[i] -= 1
                i += 1
                quantum += 1
            tasks_map = sorted(tasks_map, reverse = True)
        return quantum
```
