## Problem Description

Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

Example 1:
```
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
```
Note:
```
Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
The divisor will never be 0.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 231 − 1 when the division result overflows.
```
## Ideas
We can use log(n) ^ 2's approach to this problem by multiplying the divisor until it will no longer
fit dividend. Do this repeatedly.

## Algorithm Analysis
Linear Search is too slow because at each step, we only subtract one copy of the divisor from the dividend. A better way would be to try and subtract multiple copies of the divisor each time.

One way of quickly increasing numbers, without using multiplication, is to double them repeatedly. So let's try doubling the divisor until it no longer fits into the dividend.

It'll be easiest to understand with an example, so let's say we have a dividend of 93706 and a divisor of 157. We'll now just see what happens when we repeatedly double 157 until it's bigger than 93706.
## Code

```py
class Solution(object):
    def divide(self, dividend, divisor):
        """
        :type dividend: int
        :type divisor: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Constants.
        MAX_INT = 2147483647        # 2**31 - 1
        MIN_INT = -2147483648       # -2**31
        HALF_MIN_INT = -1073741824  # MIN_INT // 2
        HALF_MAX_INT = 1073741824   # MAX_INT // 2
        # Special case: overflow.
        if dividend == MIN_INT and divisor == -1:
            return MAX_INT

        negatives = 0
        if dividend < 0:
            negatives += 1
            dividend = -dividend
        if divisor < 0:
            negatives += 1
            divisor = -divisor

        quotient = 0
        while divisor <= dividend:
            value = divisor
            powerOfTwo = 1
            while value <= HALF_MAX_INT and value * 2 <= dividend:
                value *= 2
                powerOfTwo *= 2
            quotient += powerOfTwo
            dividend -= value
        return quotient if negatives != 1 else -quotient
