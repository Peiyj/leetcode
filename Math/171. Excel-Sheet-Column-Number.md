## Problem Description

Given a column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

For example:
```
    A -> 1
    B -> 2
    C -> 3
    ...
    Z -> 26
    AA -> 27
    AB -> 28 
    ...
```    
Example 1:
```
Input: "A"
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "AB"
Output: 28
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "ZY"
Output: 701
```
## Ideas
Similar to translate to binary. In this case, it is base 26.



## Algorithm Analysis
Observe that this is basically the same thing as converting between base 26 and base 10.

## Code

```py
class Solution(object):
    def titleToNumber(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        number = 0
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
            number = number + (26 ** count) * (ord(s[i]) - ord('A') + 1)
            count += 1
        return number
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)
```
