## Problem Description
Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3 
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```
## Ideas
Dynamic programming approach: similar to coin change. In this case, we are given sqrt(n) 
amount of coins. (i.e. 16: {1,4,9,16}). At each subproblem :
f[i] = min(f[i], f[i - each squaredNum]).

## Algorithm Analysis

Dynamic programming approach: 
Step 1) create a maxNum number that denotes all squared root integer number of n

step 2) initialize our change array to be with value n and n + 1 size

step 3) at each subproblem i, the value of change[i] will be 
change[i] = min(change[i], change[i - each squaredNum]).

greedy approach: 
Step 1) we prepare a list of square numbers (named square_nums) that are less than the given number n. 

Step 2) In the main loop, iterating the size of combination (named count) from one to n, we check if 
the number n can be divided by the sum of the combination, i.e. is_divided_by(n, count). 
The function is_divided_by(n, count) can be implemented in the form of recursion as we defined in the intuition section.

Step 3) In the bottom case, we have count==1, we just need to check if the number n is a square number itself. We could use the inclusion test with the list square_nums that we prepared before, i.e. n \in \text{square\_nums}nâˆˆsquare_nums. And if we use the set data structure for square_nums, we could obtain a faster running time than the approach of n == int(sqrt(n)) ^ 2.

bfs:

Similar to greedy but use bfs.

## Code
approach 1: dynamic programming
```py
class Solution(object):
    def numSquares(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        maxNum = int(math.sqrt(n))
        change = [n] * (n + 1)
        # preprocess
        change[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, maxNum + 1):
            change[i*i] = 1 
        # post dp
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, maxNum + 1):
                # check bound
                squaredNum = j*j
                if (i - squaredNum < 0):
                    continue
                change[i] = min(change[i], change[i - squaredNum] + 1)
        return change[n]
       
```
approach 2: greedy enumeration
```py
class Solution(object):
    maxNumDict = {}
    def numSquares(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            self.maxNumDict[i*i] = 1
        
        for count in range(1, n + 1):
            if self.is_divided(n, count):
                return count
    def is_divided(self, n, count):
        if count == 1:
            return n in self.maxNumDict
        for k in self.maxNumDict.keys():
            if self.is_divided(n - k, count - 1):
                return True
        return False
        
```
approach 3: breadth first search
```py
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n):
        # list of square numbers that are less than `n`
        square_nums = {}
        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            square_nums[i * i] = 1
        nodeQueue = [n]
        level = 0
        while nodeQueue:
            level += 1
            nextLevel = []
            for node in nodeQueue:
                for k in square_nums.keys():
                    if node - k < 0:
                        continue
                    elif node - k == 0:
                        return level
                    else:
                        nextLevel.append(node - k)
            nodeQueue = nextLevel
        return level
                        
    
```
