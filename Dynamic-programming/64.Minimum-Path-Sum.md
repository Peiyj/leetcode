## Problem Description

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```
## Ideas

In order to travel to our current position f[i][j], we either come from top (f[i-1][j]) or from left(f[i][j-1]).

## Algorithm Analysis
```
F[i][j] = min(f[i-1][j] + cost[i][j], f[i][j-1] + cost[i][j])
```
## Code
```py
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        f = [[0 for _ in range(len(grid[0]))] for j in range(len(grid))]
        
        f[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        
        for row in range(1, len(grid)):
            f[row][0] = f[row - 1][0] + grid[row][0]
        
        for col in range(1, len(grid[0])):
            f[0][col] = f[0][col - 1] + grid[0][col]
            
        for row in range(1, len(grid)):
            for col in range(1, len(grid[row])):
                f[row][col] = min(grid[row][col] + f[row - 1][col], grid[row][col] + f[row][col - 1])
        return f[len(grid) - 1][len(grid[0]) - 1]
        
```

## Complexity Analysis
